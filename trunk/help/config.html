<p>Lets first take a look at the main ShuiCast screen:</p>

<img src="shuicast_main.png" border="0"  alt="graphic" ><br/><br/>
<img src="configurationb2.png"  width="391"  height="71"  border="0"  alt="graphic" >

<p>The Metadata box is used to display the current metadata that is being sent to 
each of the configured broadcast servers. This metadata is taken by default 
from the media player and can be overridden by clicking the "Edit" button by the 
Metadata label.</p>

<h2>Editing Metadata</h2>

<p>When the Edit button is clicked, the following window appears:</p>

<img src="configurationb3.png"  width="393"  height="316"  border="0"  alt="graphic" >

<p>This window has 2 sections, one for entering the metadata manually, and that 
can be used for more automated tasks. To enter the metadata manually, simply 
enter the metadata in the supplied box and click "OK". This will cause the 
current metadata to be what you just entered. Additionally, you may "Lock" the 
metadata, which will prevent any other updates (via the media player or via the 
external Metadata) to override what you entered. This is, in general, used to set 
the metadata in a more permanent fashion.</p>
<p>In addition to entering the metadata manually, you can configure ShuiCast to get 
metadata from external sources. Currently, only file and URL are supported. A 
interval is specified and every interval, ShuiCast will either access the File or URL 
and use that data as it's metadata. If using a File, then ShuiCast will read the first 
line of the file and use that as the metadata, and if using a URL, it will similarly 
read the first line in the response from the URL call.</p>

<h2>Live Recording</h2>

<img src="configurationb4.png"  width="213"  height="76"  border="0"  alt="graphic" >

<p>The live recording section of the main ShuiCast window is used to enable and 
disable live recording within ShuiCast. To enable live recording, simply click on 
the microphone icon <img src="configurationb5.png"  width="34"  height="31"  border="0"  alt="graphic" >.
Additionally, you can configure which device will be 
used as the recording device by selecting it from the dropdown in the live 
recording section of the ShuiCast config. Right below this dropdown is a slider 
control which controls the recording level for that recording device. Each 
recording device has a separate volume control.</p>

<h2>Encoder Settings</h2>

<img src="configurationb6.png"  width="408"  height="204"  border="0"  alt="graphic" >

<p>This section is the meat of the configuration of ShuiCast. This is where you add 
encoders for each of your desired streams. Each encoder can be configured 
independently and each of them have their own set of configuration parameters. 
For the sake of this documentation, we will walk through configuring a single 
encoder, and adding additional encoders should be iterations of the first.</p>
<p>You will see 2 buttons and a check box in this section of the ShuiCast main 
window. The "Connect" button is used to connect all defined encoders. 
Additionally individual encoders can be specificially connected by right clicking 
on them. The AutoConnect checkbox can be used to automatically connect all 
the defined encoders on ShuiCast startup. When this checkbox is checked, 
ShuiCast will automatically initiate a "Connect" action on each of the encoders 5 
seconds after ShuiCast startup.</p>
<p>Also, new encoders can be added by clicking the "Add encoder" button.
To configure a new or existing encoder, simply double click on it and the 
configuration screen will appear. There are 3 sections to the configuration 
screen.</p>

<h3>Basic Settings</h3>

<img src="configurationb7.png"  width="539"  height="424"  border="0"  alt="graphic" >

<p>The following describes each of the settings:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Bitrate</dt>
<dd>This value is used only for MP3 streams. For Ogg Vorbis and AAC streams, Quality is used.</dd>
<dt>Quality</dt>
<dd>This value is used for Ogg Vorbis streams and AAC Streams. Valid values for Ogg Vorbis are -1 through 10, and for AAC 10 through 500.</dd>
<dt>Samplerate</dt>
<dd>In the case of MP3, this must be a valid MP3 samplerate (11025, 22050, 44100), but in the case of Ogg Vorbis it is arbitrary. Not sure about AAC.</dd>
<dt>Channels</dt>
<dd>1 for Mono, 2 for Stereo</dd>
<dt>Encoder Type</dt>
<dd>Only supported encoder types will appear in this listbox. This means, if you didn't download lame_enc.dll or libfaac.dll, then you won't be able to select it from this dropdown.</dd>
<dt>Server Type</dt>
<dd>Valid values are Shoutcast and Icecast2. Selecting the wrong one will result in connection errors.</dd>
<dt>Server IP</dt>
<dd>The server IP or hostname for the broadcasting server (i.e. Shoutcast/Icecast2)</dd>
<dt>Server Port</dt>
<dd>The port that your broadcasting server is running on.</dd>
<dt>Encoder Password</dt>
<dd>You must make sure that the encoder paswords match between ShuiCast and the broadcasting server.</dd>
<dt>Mountpoint</dt>
<dd>Mountpoints are appropriate ONLY for icecast2 server types. They are a unique identifier for your stream (icecast2 can handle multiple simultaneous streams). 
Most listening clients rely on the extention of the mountpoint to choose the correct decoder for your stream. This means, that Ogg Vorbis streams must end 
in .ogg (i.e. /stream.ogg), AAC streams must end in .aac (/stream.acc), and (by convention) MP3 may or may not need an extension (/stream). Note that all 
mountpoints MUST start with a '/'.</dd>
<dt>Reconnect Seconds</dt>
<dd>This is the number of seconds to pause in between reconnection attempts. (Reconnection is currently automatic).</dd>
</dl>

<h3>YP Settings</h3>

<img src="configurationb8.png"  width="539"  height="424"  border="0"  alt="graphic" >

<p>The following describes each of the settings:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Public Server</dt>
<dd>If Checked, this stream will be marked as "public" and if your broadcast server is configured with a yellow pages (stream directory), it will be listed there.</dd>
<dt>Stream Name</dt>
<dd>The name of your stream.</dd>
<dt>Stream Description</dt>
<dd>A short description of your stream.</dd>
<dt>Stream URL</dt>
<dd>The website associated with your stream.</dd>
<dt>Stream Genre</dt>
<dd>Your stream genre (can be multiples)</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Advanced Settings</h3>

<img src="configurationb9.png"  width="539"  height="424"  border="0"  alt="graphic" >

<p>The following describes each of the settings:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Save Archive Of Stream</dt>
<dd>If this value is checked, then ShuiCast will save an archive of your stream in the directory specified. The file will be named based off a timestamp and the stream name.</dd>
<dt>Save As WAV</dt>
<dd>If this option is checked, then a high-quality archive will be kept. Warning, you better have LOTS of disk space if you enable this.</dd>
<dt>Archive Directory</dt>
<dd>The directory in which archive broadcasts will be saved.</dd>
<dt>Log Level</dt>
<dd>This is for debugging ShuiCast, 1 = debug, 4 = error. * for advanced uses only</dd>
<dt>Log File</dt>
<dd>If no log file is specified, then no log file will be produced.</dd>
</dl>
